Followed a John Hammond video for this one.

Introduced to the Python library 'pwn', specifically pwn.shellcraft for crafting shell code.

Command line code for this challenge:
(python -c "import pwn; print(pwn.asm(pwn.shellcraft.linux.sh()))" ; cat) | ./vuln

This piped the printed output from Python into the 'vuln' file, while leaving standard
input open, meaning our gid changed to reflect where the shell was open. This allowed
cat flag.txt to be executed because we now had permissions.
